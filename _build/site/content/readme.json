Many recent reviews for a lot of outdoor gear feature an overview, pluses/minuses, cost and honest reviewing, except they lack evaluations of how products work over longer periods. Often the reviewer has just used the product a few times.","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"key":"g581Agi43I"}],"key":"AaIoPcu03P"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Guide","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"tzJvTjQFDg"}],"identifier":"guide","label":"Guide","html_id":"guide","implicit":true,"key":"AvyPvcTfAn"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1},"end":{"line":8,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This guide features short, to-the-point reviews of kayak gear, some of it long-term.
