Many recent reviews for a lot of outdoor gear feature an overview, pluses/minuses, cost and honest reviewing, except they lack evaluations of how products work over longer periods.

But I soon realized that having a hood in wind blows and you never use the hoods anyway so it’s awesome. The suit is duper durable with cordura in hard wearing areas. I found the latex neck seal to be very tight and had to cut several notches down to fit me (and I have a pretty skinny neck). It was so tight it felt like someone was choking me and I dreaded putting it on. Once I trimmed it, it was fine. Besides the neck the suit fits well. I found the shoulder zipper to be difficult to reach and close, but that became much easier with a few applications of ti-zip to lube it. The flap over the zipper also gets stuck up or the wind blows it up. Seems like this could be removed, or fixed down with some double sided velcro.\n\nThis suit doesn’t breath as well as more expensive suits, but if you layer right, you can avoid excessive moisture build up on the inside. It dries very fast, even the booties. I’ve had mine for 3 years and the only sign of wear is in the ‘socks’ and I had to sew and patch the neoprene in the neck after it tore. Really good value for money, especially for your first suit when you’re trying things out and don’t want to spend a ton on new kit.","type":"content","url":"/yak-dry#summary","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Yak Horizon Drysuit","lvl2":"Buyer"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/yak-dry#buyer","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Yak Horizon Drysuit","lvl2":"Buyer"},"content":"Entry level kayakers that need a drysuit but don’t want to spend >£600 to get going.","type":"content","url":"/yak-dry#buyer","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Yak Horizon Drysuit","lvl2":"Specs"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/yak-dry#specs","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Yak Horizon Drysuit","lvl2":"Specs"},"content":"Cost: RRP £645 but this Escape has it at £299.99 during the writing of this review.\n\nWeight:\n\nURL: \n\nhttps://​www​.escape​-watersports​.co​.uk​/products​/yak​-horizon​-drysuit​?variant​=​49424379085124​&​gad​_campaignid​=​18342594392\n\nReview date: 14 October 2025","type":"content","url":"/yak-dry#specs","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Whetman Hatch Covers"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/hatches","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Whetman Hatch Covers"},"content":"PROS\n\nCONS\n\n🟢 Nicely made, fit most hatches\n\n🟡 Fitting on in cold weather can be hard\n\n🟢 Come in different colors!\n\n🟡 Seem pricey for hatches","type":"content","url":"/hatches","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Whetman Hatch Covers","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/hatches#summary","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Whetman Hatch Covers","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"Different colors, deck out your boat with rad colored hatches.","type":"content","url":"/hatches#summary","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Whetman Hatch Covers","lvl2":"Buyer"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/hatches#buyer","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Whetman Hatch Covers","lvl2":"Buyer"},"content":"Anyone that wants to or needs to replace the hatches that came with their boat.
