# Summary
This is more of a first impressions review since I've only worn the drysuit on the water once at the time of initial review. 

Putting on/taking off. Zipper a bit fiddly doig it solo as the shoulders are large for me 
While paddling. Very comfy, almost didn't notice it at all.
Materials, very high quality materials and design

Downsides of big fit, large socks
