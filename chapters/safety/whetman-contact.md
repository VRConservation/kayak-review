# Summary
I have to admit I have a love/hate relationship with the Whetman Sea Contact Tow MK11. While paddline, it has the tendency to unravel or come undone from it's origami-like folding and the miserly amount of velcro used to secure it doesn't help. However, the carbiners and quick deployment make it easy to use when it's needed. It's also highly adjustable so usable on multiple boats. This contact tow would be perfect if the folding up/stowage was improved substantially.

Before puchasing this unit, I made contact tows with climbing equipment and rope, but went through a number of carabiners that froze after saltwater contact or that weren't the right shape for easy deployment. None of them had a quick release toggle, but that would have been easy to add. Finding the right pieces will make a more customized, and perhaps more stowable contact tow, but how much time and money do you spend on that before getting it right?

# Buyer
Any paddler, especially trip leaders and coaches, but having this safety device for quick retrieval of wayward boats or easier contact tows with casualties is a must.
